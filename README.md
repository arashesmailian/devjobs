# Devjob web app

![Design preview for the Devjob web app coding challenge](./preview.jpg)

## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge. Build a jobs board that pulls data from a local JSON file.

**To do this challenge, you need a solid understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Reactjs.**

- **Bonus**: use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)

## The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this jobs board using a local `data.json` to retrieve the data. Your goal is to try to get your project looking as close to the design as possible.

We provide the data in a local `data.json` file, so use that to populate the content on the first load. If you want to take it up a notch, feel free to build this as a full-stack application!

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements throughout the site
- Be able to filter jobs on the index page by title, location, and whether a job is for a full-time position
- Be able to click a job from the index page so that they can read more information and apply for the job
- **Bonus**: Have the correct color scheme chosen for them based on their computer preferences. _Hint_: Research `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS.

## Where to find everything

Your task is to build out the project to the design file. The design system in the design file will give you more information about the various colors, fonts, and styles used in this project.
**Please be sure not to share them with anyone else.**

All the required assets for this project are in the `/assets` folder. The assets are already exported for the correct screen size and optimized. Some images are reusable at multiple screen sizes. So if you don't see an image in a specific folder, it will typically be in another folder for that page.

## Building your project

Feel free to use any workflow that you feel comfortable with. Below is a suggested process, but do not feel like you need to follow these steps:

1. create a brand new project. Initialize the codebase as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/). If you're not sure how to do this, [have a read-through of this Try Git resource](https://try.github.io/). **‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT ‚ö†Ô∏è: There are already a couple of `.gitignore` files in this project. Please do not remove them or change the content of the files. If you create a brand new project, please use the `.gitignore` files provided in your new codebase. This is to avoid the accidental upload of the design files to GitHub. Thanks!**
2. Look through the designs to start planning out how you'll tackle the project. This step is crucial to help you think ahead for CSS classes to create reusable styles.
3. Before adding any styles, structure your content with HTML. Writing your HTML first can help focus your attention on creating well-structured content.
4. Write out the base styles for your project, including general content styles, such as `font-family` and `font-size`.
5. Start adding styles to the top of the page and work down. Only move on to the next section once you're happy you've completed the area you're working on.

**Have fun building!** üöÄ
